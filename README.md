Welcome to my 3D top-down shooter game project, built using Unity. This game delivers a simple yet fun gameplay experience with 3D models, sound effects, and classic shooter mechanics.

## 🎮 Game Overview

- Navigate a top-down world with randomized ground colors each session.
- Aim using the mouse and shoot enemies using the left click.
- Destroy enemies and rack up your score.
- When the player loses, a "Game Over" screen appears with a restart button.

## 🕹️ Controls

|--------------|--------------------|
| Move         | W / A / S / D      |
| Aim          | Mouse              |
| Shoot        | Left Mouse Button  |
